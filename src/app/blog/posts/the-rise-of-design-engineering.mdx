As technology advances at breakneck speed, UX design frameworks struggle to keep up. The emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) systems — capable of creating novel text, images, and even software solutions — has redefined the role of design in digital products. Yet, the methods we rely on to design these experiences often feel like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Conventional design frameworks simply weren't built to handle the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI systems.

## The UX Design Gap
Traditional UX frameworks, from Double Diamond models to design thinking playbooks, thrive in environments where user interactions follow predictable paths. They guide teams through static workflows, with clear user goals and defined error states. But GenAI isn't like that. It's messy, iterative, and full of uncertainties. The output isn't always predictable, nor is the way users interact with it.

Imagine designing for an AI system that writes poetry based on a user's mood. What happens when the user isn't happy with the poem? How do we handle biases or ethical dilemmas in generated content? These challenges require design frameworks that embrace uncertainty, support dynamic user flows, and incorporate real-time feedback.

## Challenges Faced by Designers and Practitioners
Designers, developers, and product managers working with GenAI face countless hurdles:

- Error handling: How do you design interfaces that gracefully manage unexpected or nonsensical AI outputs?
- Ethics and trust: How do you ensure users trust the AI when its outputs can be opaque or even controversial?
- Iterative design: How can teams test and refine AI-driven experiences in iterative cycles when outcomes are unpredictable?
- Variable interfaces: Unlike static apps, GenAI systems require interfaces that adapt to different user needs and states.
- Existing tools like design cards and UI kits often fall short because they weren't built with these complexities in mind.

## My Current Research
These challenges and gaps are at the core of my current research, which focuses on exploring how we can develop practical, actionable design frameworks tailored for GenAI applications. I’m investigating the limitations of existing design resources and seeking to understand how GenAI practitioners engage with these frameworks — or why they often don’t. Ultimately, the goal is to propose methods and tools that make design frameworks more relevant, adaptable, and useful for real-world GenAI systems.

## A Call for Practical, Actionable Frameworks
If we're going to design meaningful, user-centered GenAI experiences, we need a fundamental shift in how we approach UX design. We must go beyond abstract guidelines and develop practical, adaptable resources that account for the unique challenges of GenAI. This means:

- Creating iterative design processes that support rapid testing and feedback loops.
- Developing new patterns and tools to address variable interface states, error management, and user trust.
- Integrating ethical considerations at every stage of the design process.
- Building customizable UI kits that prioritize user flows rather than static components.

## Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice
Academic research has started to identify high-level principles for GenAI design, but these principles often remain theoretical. What’s missing are actionable methods that practitioners can easily integrate into their workflows. Companies like Google and Microsoft have developed AI design guidelines, but they aren't always adaptable to the dynamic needs of GenAI systems. There's a clear opportunity to bridge this gap by developing more practical and context-sensitive design resources.

## Looking Ahead
As GenAI continues to evolve, UX designers, developers, and product managers have a crucial role to play. By rethinking and adapting our design frameworks, we can ensure that GenAI applications are user-centered, transparent, accessible, and ethical. It's an exciting time to be in design, but we need to rise to the challenge and build the tools and processes that will enable us to navigate this new frontier.

Through my research, I hope to contribute to this ongoing effort — creating a foundation for UX design that keeps pace with the ever-changing landscape of GenAI applications. Like all meaningful design work, this evolution will be iterative, and I'm excited to be part of the journey.
