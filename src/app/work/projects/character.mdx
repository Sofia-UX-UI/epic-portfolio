### Summary

As a Product Designer, I co-led the creation of *Character Designer*, a generative AI-based web app developed during the AI Encode Bootcamp. The tool empowers users to design unique characters by generating high-quality images and detailed narrative backstories using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo and StabilityAI’s Stable Diffusion. My role included user research, ideation, prototyping, and usability testing, ensuring a gamified and user-friendly experience aligned with the needs of creatives.

### Timeframe

3 weeks (2024)

### Key Objectives

1. **Develop a GenAI tool** capable of generating  images and backstories with user customization.
2. **Design a user-centered gamified interface** that aligns with the needs and user goals.
3. **Ensure consistent visual quality:** Integrate a stabilization feature for consistency across various character styles.
4. Validate the tool’s usability:  conduct usability testing and gather feedback..

## **Results delivered**

- **AI Integration and Scalability**:
    - Generated over **100 unique characters**, combining visuals and backstories.
    - Achieved a **95% user satisfaction rate**, as measured through post-testing surveys.
- **Improved Usability**:
    - Designed a gamified interface informed by insights from **8 creatives** (via interviews and testing).
    - Reduced task completion time by **30%** through **7 iterative design revisions**, enhancing efficiency and satisfaction.
- **Rapid Development and Delivery**:
    - Delivered a fully functional prototype within **21 days**, demonstrating adaptability and scalability.
- **Industry Validation**:
    - Received positive feedback from **two senior AI experts**, highlighting the innovative UI and seamless integration of generative AI technologies.

## Concept and Experience

Character Designer was envisioned as a tool to assist creatives in the character creation process, helping them generate detailed visual and narrative content more efficiently. The app supports various art styles, customizable character traits, and user-driven storytelling, acknowledging that AI complements creative work rather than replacing it.

# **AI Model & Dataset Overview**

- **Models Used**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for text generation and StabilityAI’s Stable Diffusion 1.6 for image generation.
- **Data**: Utilized pre-trained models capable of handling diverse creative demands without additional fine-tuning.
- **Challenges**: Fine-tuning the balance between image variety and consistency, ensuring outputs reflected user customization without diverging too drastically.

# **User Research and Design Process**

Initial research included a questionnaire from 8+ creatives, revealing that users prioritized customizable traits and export flexibility. Given the niche nature of the target audience and the rapid 2-day timeframe, these insights were instrumental in shaping the design process. Based on these insights, I developed user personas and mapped user journeys that informed the design.

- **User Flow**: Focused on intuitive navigation with clear steps for creating and saving characters.
- **Prototyping**: Early sketches and wireframes were iterated upon using Figma, incorporating user feedback to refine design elements.

# **Prototyping and Iterative Design**

Prototypes evolved through continuous validation with the team and potential users. The UI was designed to be playful and inviting, featuring a palette of Soft Peach (FEDADB), Lavender Mist (E4D9FF), and Mint Green (DDF5DA) for an accessible yet vibrant look. 7 iterations were created from user feedback and team validations.

- **Design System**: Preline UI and Material Design components were used for faster implementation.
- **Feedback Loop**: A usability testing workshop involving some of the users that previously answered the questionnaire led to further refinements, such as clearer navigation and streamlined interaction paths.

# **Development and Integration**

The development phase focused on integrating APIs for GPT-3.5 and Stable Diffusion. Image stabilization techniques were implemented to maintain visual quality and consistency.

- **Challenges**: Ensuring stable output while maintaining diverse customization options, running locally to not pay for ChatGTP.
- **Solutions**: Adjusted API parameters for consistent results and optimized server-side processes to handle real-time requests, using ChatGTP.

# **Industry Feedback**

Industry experts praised the intuitive UI and engaging demo. Constructive feedback included suggestions for integrating image generation within story creation for a more cohesive experience.
