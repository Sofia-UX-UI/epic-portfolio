### Summary

As a Product Designer, I led the creation of *Character Designer*, a generative AI-based web app developed during the AI Encode Bootcamp. The tool empowers users to design unique characters by generating high-quality images and detailed narrative backstories using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo and StabilityAI’s Stable Diffusion. My role included user research, ideation, prototyping, and usability testing, ensuring a gamified and user-friendly experience aligned with the needs of creatives.

### Timeframe

3 weeks (2024)

### Key Objectives

1. **Develop a GenAI tool** capable of generating  images and backstories with user customization.
2. **Design a user-centered gamified interface** that aligns with the needs and user goals.
3. **Ensure consistent visual quality:** Integrate a stabilization feature for consistency across various character styles.
4. Validate the tool’s usability:  conduct usability testing and gather feedback..

## **Results delivered**

- **AI Integration and Scalability**:
    - Generated over **100 unique characters**, combining visuals and backstories.
    - Achieved a **95% user satisfaction rate**, as measured through post-testing surveys.
- **Improved Usability**:
    - Designed a gamified interface informed by insights from **8 creatives** (via interviews and testing).
    - Reduced task completion time by **30%** through **7 iterative design revisions**, enhancing efficiency and satisfaction.
- **Rapid Development and Delivery**:
    - Delivered a fully functional prototype within **21 days**, demonstrating adaptability and scalability.
- **Industry Validation**:
    - Received positive feedback from **two senior AI experts**, highlighting the innovative UI and seamless integration of generative AI technologies.

## Concept and Experience

Character Designer was envisioned as a tool to assist creatives in the character creation process, helping them generate detailed visual and narrative content more efficiently. The app supports various art styles, customizable character traits, and user-driven storytelling, acknowledging that AI complements creative work rather than replacing it.

# **AI Model & Dataset Overview**

- **Models Used**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for text generation and StabilityAI’s Stable Diffusion 1.6 for image generation.
- **Data**: Utilized pre-trained models capable of handling diverse creative demands without additional fine-tuning.
- **Challenges**: Fine-tuning the balance between image variety and consistency, ensuring outputs reflected user customization without diverging too drastically.
