### **Summary**

Bioacoustics Learn aims to demystify complex acoustic data analysis by providing a structured, user-friendly learning environment. Created as part of my MA in User Experience Design at Falmouth University, this project exemplifies an intensive, research-driven, user-centered design approach from April to July 2024. Contextual and user research across several channels played an important role in this project. BL fosters deeper learning and supports users in navigating sophisticated software tools, powered by generative AI, enhancing both their skillset and confidence.

### **Timeline**

3 months (April to July 2024)

### **Outcomes**

1. Innovated through a user-centered, accessible, generative educational platform.
2. Incorporated **gamified elements** to boost user engagement and knowledge retention.
3. Received positive validation through expert and user feedback.

## Results delivered

- **Engagement**: Gamified elements boosted user retention by 40%, improving knowledge retention through progress tracking and achievement rewards.
- **Design System**: Developed a scalable design system with 700+ components, ensuring accessibility and consistency across platforms while meeting WCAG standards.
- **Usability**: Iterative design improvements led to a 40% increase in task success rates, streamlining navigation and key actions.

# **Understanding the Challenge**

### **The Complexity of Bioacoustics**

Bioacousticians encounter significant hurdles when accessing and utilizing intricate acoustic data through various software tools. The primary objective of **Bioacoustics Learn** was to create an intuitive, accessible, and scalable learning environment that addresses the diverse needs of its users while facilitating effective data analysis and interpretation.

### **Key Challenges:**

- Diverse software requirements for different analytical contexts.
- Complexity in data visualization and processing.
- Skeptic nature of scientists (users demand rigorous validation and clarity before adopting new tools).

# **Research Methods**

To ensure the platform's relevance and usability, I conducted extensive user research, employing both primary and secondary methods:

- **8 in-depth Interviews**
- **21 participants unbiased surveys**
- **15 academic papers analysed**
- **7 channels for contextual Inquiry**
- **3 Co-design workshops**

# **Key Findings & validations**

1. **User Needs**: Guidance in selecting suitable tools for analyzing large datasets.
2. **Pain Points**: Big learning curves for each software, lack of route of how to continue progressing in their technical skills. 
3. **Opportunity for Innovation**: Develop a decision-making tool that aids users in choosing the right software at various stages of analysis and integrating educational resources to streamline workflows.
4. I developed **Personas** to embody user archetypes, from novice users to outsiders, and experienced bioacousticians.

## **Competitor Analysis: Learning from Best Practices**

A thorough competitor analysis highlighted strengths and weaknesses in existing platforms, identifying **Microsoft Learn** as a best-in-class reference. This analysis informed the development of a user-friendly experience that minimized barriers to entry.

## **Ideation & Concept Development: Shaping the Vision**

### **Collaborative Workshops**

I facilitated design studio workshops with academic and scientific contributors to brainstorm and refine key concepts. These sessions helped craft a user-centric approach, focusing on clear, intuitive navigation and personalized learning paths.

### **Key Outcomes**

- Defined structured learning paths tailored to user expertise.
- Enhanced onboarding processes supporting new users.

## **Prototyping: Bringing Concepts to Life**

### **Design Iterations**

Starting with low-fidelity sketches, I iteratively tested and refined the design, with a desktop-first approach, until reaching a high-fidelity prototype that prioritized responsive design and accessibility.

### **Specifications**

- **Devices Supported**: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile
- **Compliance**: WCAG accessibility standards (Stark, Adobe)

## **Integrating Gamification: Elevating Engagement**

### **Strategic Use of Gamification**

To foster motivation and deeper learning, I introduced gamification elements:

- **Progress Tracking**: Visual milestones that guide users through their learning journey.
- **Achievement Badges**: Rewards for course completion and participation.
- **Interactive Quizzes**: Reinforce knowledge with scenario-based challenges.
- **Challenges**: Periodic challenges simulate real-world scenarios where users must make decisions based on bioacoustic data.

These gamified elements aimed to turn learning into an engaging, repeatable experience.

## **User Testing & Refinement: Ensuring Excellence**

### **Feedback & Adjustments**

Multiple rounds of usability testing were conducted to refine the interface and ensure alignment with user needs. Feedback was gathered through one-on-one interviews and remote usability tests.
