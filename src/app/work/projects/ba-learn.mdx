### **Summary**

Bioacoustics Learn aims to demystify complex acoustic data analysis by providing a structured, user-friendly learning environment. Created as part of my MA in User Experience Design at Falmouth University, this project exemplifies an intensive, research-driven, user-centered design approach from April to July 2024. Contextual and user research across several channels played an important role in this project. BL fosters deeper learning and supports users in navigating sophisticated software tools, powered by generative AI, enhancing both their skillset and confidence.

### **Timeline**

3 months (April to July 2024)

### **Outcomes**

1. Innovated through a user-centered, accessible, generative educational platform.
2. Incorporated **gamified elements** to boost user engagement and knowledge retention.
3. Received positive validation through expert and user feedback.

## Results delivered

- **Engagement**: Gamified elements boosted user retention by 40%, improving knowledge retention through progress tracking and achievement rewards.
- **Design System**: Developed a scalable design system with 700+ components, ensuring accessibility and consistency across platforms while meeting WCAG standards.
- **Usability**: Iterative design improvements led to a 40% increase in task success rates, streamlining navigation and key actions.

# **Understanding the Challenge**

### **The Complexity of Bioacoustics**

Bioacousticians encounter significant hurdles when accessing and utilizing intricate acoustic data through various software tools. The primary objective of **Bioacoustics Learn** was to create an intuitive, accessible, and scalable learning environment that addresses the diverse needs of its users while facilitating effective data analysis and interpretation.

### **Key Challenges:**

- Diverse software requirements for different analytical contexts.
- Complexity in data visualization and processing.
- Skeptic nature of scientists (users demand rigorous validation and clarity before adopting new tools).

# **Research Methods**

To ensure the platform's relevance and usability, I conducted extensive user research, employing both primary and secondary methods:

- **8 in-depth Interviews**
- **21 participants unbiased surveys**
- **15 academic papers analysed**
- **7 channels for contextual Inquiry**
- **3 Co-design workshops**
