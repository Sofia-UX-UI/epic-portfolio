## Overview

As a Product Designer with a focus on Growth, I collaborated with Astropay's Purchase Squad to redesign the 'Add Money' flow. This initiative aimed to eliminate user pain points, improve task efficiency, and deliver an inclusive solution for diverse users across Europe, Africa, and Latin America. By leveraging data insights, user research, and iterative testing, I led the team in delivering a seamless and accessible experience that reduced task abandonment and increased completion rates.

## Team

- My role: Growth Product Designer, Research.
- Michel Chorowski: Product Manager & Owner.
- Guzmán Andreatta: Design Systems. 
- Julieta Dirie: Project Manager.
- iOS/Android Developers: Implemented mobile solutions
- Web Developers: Delivered web-specific adaptations
- Operations Team: Ensured global scalability


## Timeframe

3 months (2023)


## Key Objectives

- Increase **Conversion Rates**: Redesign the 'Add Money' flow to reduce drop-off and improve task completion.

- Optimize **Landing Pages**: Simplify user journeys and highlight clear calls-to-action.

- Drive **Retention**: Enhance the user experience to increase loyalty and reduce churn.


## Research Approach

I conducted a series of research activities to identify pain points and growth opportunities:

- User Interviews: Gathered insights into common frustrations with the 'Add Money' feature.

- Heuristic Evaluation: Identified inefficiencies in the flow and landing pages.

- Data Analysis: Examined metrics like abandonment rates, conversion rates, and time-on-task.

**Key Finding**: 

Users experienced confusion due to inconsistent labels and unclear next steps, resulting in a significant drop-off at critical points in the funnel.


## Problem-Solving Approach


- **Challenge**: 

The original flow lacked clarity and failed to guide users effectively through the funnel.

- **Solution**: 

I redesigned the landing page and the entire funnel to provide a clear, step-by-step path, incorporating standardized labels, dynamic messaging, and visual feedback for users.


## Prototyping and Testing


I used an iterative design process to refine the solution:

- **Low-Fidelity Prototypes**: 

Quickly sketched wireframes to test initial concepts.

- **User Testing**: 

Conducted usability tests with 300+ participants across Europe, Africa, and Latin America.

- **High-Fidelity Prototypes**: 

Finalized designs in Figma, integrating feedback from multiple rounds of testing.


## Key Features

- **Optimized Conversion Funnel**:

Redesigned landing pages to guide users effectively and reduce drop-offs.
Added visual progress indicators and clear CTAs for transparency.

- **Global Adaptability**:

Introduced localized content and region-specific optimizations to address diverse user needs.

- **Integrated Design Systems**:

Built reusable components for consistency across platforms.


## Outcomes

The redesigned flow achieved measurable growth:

- **25% Faster Task Completion**: 

Reduced average completion time from 2 minutes to 1.5 minutes.

- **30% Increase in Accuracy**: 

Improved user precision by reducing errors during the flow.

- **18% Drop in Abandonment Rates**: 

Streamlined the funnel to retain more users.

- **15% Improved Usability Scores**: 

Post-testing validation highlighted significant user satisfaction gains.


## Growth impact

By optimizing the 'Add Money' funnel, I directly contributed to Astropay’s key business objectives:

- **Higher Retention**: 

The improved experience encouraged repeat usage.

- **Revenue Growth**: 

Increased conversions translated into more transactions and greater revenue.

- **Scalability**: 

The modular design allowed for easy adaptation in new markets.


## Challenges and Learnings


- **Data-Driven Iteration**: 

Continuous feedback loops ensured the solution met user and business needs.

- **Regional Differences**: 

Adapting designs for global audiences required balancing standardization and localization.

- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: 

Weekly workshops aligned the team on shared goals, enabling efficient delivery.
