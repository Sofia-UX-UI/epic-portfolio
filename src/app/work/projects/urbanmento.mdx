# **The Problem**

Urbanmento’s digital presence was outdated, difficult to manage, and visually disconnected from its core values of modularity, sustainability, and public use. The previous website lacked a clear structure, had poor mobile responsiveness, and no integrated way to showcase product systems or project work.

# **Timeline**

10 months (across 2 development stages)

# **Goals**

- Align the website's tone and architecture with Urbanmento’s core identity

- Integrate project and product storytelling in a unified, accessible interface

- Preserve modular clarity without plugin-heavy dependencies

- Create a semi-ecommerce structure for case study purposes

# **Design Decisions & Process**

- Rebranded the visual identity: new logo, colour palette, type system

- Reorganised site architecture: Home / About / Projects / Shop / Contact

- Removed template clutter and used Gutenberg + Spectra blocks

- Structured the Shop using WooCommerce, but hid prices to position as catalogue

- Wrote modular product descriptions for both urban and home lines

- Adapted layout spacing, typography and titles for a unified user experience

- Improved responsiveness across mobile and desktop through padding and flex fixes

# **Understanding the Challenge**

Bioacousticians encounter significant hurdles when accessing and utilizing intricate acoustic data through various software tools. The primary objective of **Bioacoustics Learn** was to create an intuitive, accessible, and scalable learning environment that addresses the diverse needs of its users while facilitating effective data analysis and interpretation.

- Diverse software requirements for different analytical contexts.
- Complexity in data visualization and processing.
- Skeptic nature of scientists (users demand rigorous validation and clarity before adopting new tools).

# **Research Methods**

To ensure the platform's relevance and usability, I conducted extensive user research, employing both primary and secondary methods:

- **8 in-depth Interviews**
- **21 participants unbiased surveys**
- **15 academic papers analysed**
- **7 channels for contextual Inquiry**
- **3 Co-design workshops**

# **Key Findings & validations**

1. **User Needs**: Guidance in selecting suitable tools for analyzing large datasets.
2. **Pain Points**: Big learning curves for each software, lack of route of how to continue progressing in their technical skills. 
3. **Opportunity for Innovation**: Develop a decision-making tool that aids users in choosing the right software at various stages of analysis and integrating educational resources to streamline workflows.
4. I developed **Personas** to embody user archetypes, from novice users to outsiders, and experienced bioacousticians.

# **Competitor Analysis: Learning from Best Practices**

A thorough competitor analysis highlighted strengths and weaknesses in existing platforms, identifying **Microsoft Learn** as a best-in-class reference. This analysis informed the development of a user-friendly experience that minimized barriers to entry.

# **Collaborative Workshops**

I facilitated design studio workshops with academic and scientific contributors to brainstorm and refine key concepts. These sessions helped craft a user-centric approach, focusing on clear, intuitive navigation and personalized learning paths.

### **Key Outcomes**

- Defined structured learning paths tailored to user expertise.
- Enhanced onboarding processes supporting new users.

# **Design Iterations**

Starting with low-fidelity sketches, I iteratively tested and refined the design, with a desktop-first approach, until reaching a high-fidelity prototype that prioritized responsive design and accessibility.

### **Specifications**

- **Devices Supported**: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile
- **Compliance**: WCAG accessibility standards (Stark, Adobe)

# **Integrating Gamification: Elevating Engagement**

To foster motivation and deeper learning, I introduced gamification elements:

- **Progress Tracking**: Visual milestones that guide users through their learning journey.
- **Achievement Badges**: Rewards for course completion and participation.
- **Interactive Quizzes**: Reinforce knowledge with scenario-based challenges.
- **Challenges**: Periodic challenges simulate real-world scenarios where users must make decisions based on bioacoustic data.

These gamified elements aimed to turn learning into an engaging, repeatable experience.

# **Usability testing**

Multiple rounds of usability testing were conducted to refine the interface and ensure alignment with user needs. Feedback was gathered through one-on-one interviews and remote usability tests.

# Design System Creation

To address the platform's growing complexity and improve team collaboration, I created a design system based on key principles that guided my work:

- **Scalability**: to support the platform's growth.
- **Variables**: by using tokens for colors, typography, and spacing, I ensured both consistency and flexibility across designs and teams.
- **Responsiveness**: I focused on making the system adaptable to different devices and screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Creating WCAG-compliant components was a priority to ensure an inclusive user experience.
- **Handoff-Friendly**: I developed detailed documentation and assets to streamline the workflow for developers and future designers.
- **Future-Proofing**: to evolve with the platform and accommodate the needs of a growing team.

# Workflow: From Audit to Handoff

To ensure clarity and reusability, I followed a structured workflow, moving step-by-step from auditing existing designs to final handoff.

# **Results**

- **Improved Usability**: Through iterative design and testing, usability improved significantly. For instance, after incorporating user feedback, path navigation and key actions (e.g., starting courses) were simplified, reducing confusion and increasing task success rates.
- **User-Centered Design**: Validation sessions and usability testing highlighted the platform's intuitive UI and accessibility, receiving positive feedback from practitioners and lecturers in the bioacoustics field.
- **Gamified Engagement**: Features such as progress tracking and achievement rewards boosted user interaction and retention, demonstrating the effectiveness of gamification.
- **Sustainable Design System**: The comprehensive design system with built-in components and tokens supports platform scalability and ensures consistency for future feature additions.
- **Community-Oriented Features**: Early connections with users helped build a supportive community and generated actionable insights for further iterations.

# **Key Metrics**

- **Usability Testing**: A 49% usability success score (Mission 5) highlighted areas of strong user understanding, while challenges in other missions (e.g., navigating courses) indicated opportunities to refine pathways and simplify CTAs.
- **User Validation Outcomes**: Senior lecturers and bioacousticians appreciated features like the dark/light mode and icon clarity, emphasizing the importance of accessible and flexible UI choices.
