# **The Problem**

Urbanmento’s digital presence was outdated, difficult to manage, and visually disconnected from its core values of modularity, sustainability, and public use. The previous website lacked a clear structure, had poor mobile responsiveness, and no integrated way to showcase product systems or project work.

# **Timeline**

10 months (across 2 development stages)

# **Goals**

- Align the website's tone and architecture with Urbanmento’s core identity

- Integrate project and product storytelling in a unified, accessible interface

- Preserve modular clarity without plugin-heavy dependencies

- Create a semi-ecommerce structure for case study purposes

# **Design Decisions & Process**

- Rebranded the visual identity: new logo, colour palette, type system

- Reorganised site architecture: Home / About / Projects / Shop / Contact

- Removed template clutter and used Gutenberg + Spectra blocks

- Structured the Shop using WooCommerce, but hid prices to position as catalogue

- Wrote modular product descriptions for both urban and home lines

- Adapted layout spacing, typography and titles for a unified user experience

- Improved responsiveness across mobile and desktop through padding and flex fixes

# **Final outcome**

- Updated Urbanmento homepage screenshot: New modular layout, simplified hierarchy, and rebranded visual identity.

- Projects page with "Modular Interventions" section: Reframed project work to reflect real-world design impact using a flexible content grid.

- Shop page with catalogue-style product listings: Used WooCommerce to organise and showcase both urban and home product lines, styled without pricing.

- Product detail page showing modular urban furniture: Focused on material, production, and design values over e-commerce sales tactics.

- Footer redesign: Added structured navigation, brand text, and clean layout consistent with the overall site experience.

# **Reflections**

- This project expanded the Urbanmento brand from built interventions to a digital system of communication and representation. It became not only a design exercise, but a platform for storytelling, modular thinking, and future case studies.
